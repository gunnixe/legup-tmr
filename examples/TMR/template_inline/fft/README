fft_general.c - general fixed point fft where input size can be adjusted

fft.c - 64-point fixed point fft where the algorithm is specifically for 64 point

Summary.pdf - FFT presentation given on May 26, summarizing the Legup and Altera implementations

verilog - folder containing custom verilog FFT written to contrast with Altera FFT Megafunction.
          This consists of 3 files, FFT.v as well as mult.v and mult_bb.v, the Altera LPM_MULT megafunction.
					FFT_version2.v attempts to reduce the critical path by reducing multiplexing, and testbench.v
					is a testbench that was written for ModelSim simulation but never used because ModelSim
					produces the error "Enhanced FOR loop is not enabled for verilog". Therefore, all testing
					was done using the (depricated) Quartus II Simulator.
